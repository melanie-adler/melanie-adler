# Hi there! :wave:

Welcome to my page!
<br>
I am a _Berlin_ based web development student.

This is what Berlin looks like (just in case):

Other things I do:
- Go to the museum an abnormal amount of times
- Walk around the city and look at cool architecture
- Browse websites and say "Wow, nice design! (Wish I would have thought of that...)"

Feel free to ask me about stuff! ðŸš€
